# Data Transformation

DATOS-CAT project evaluates two different ETL methodologies: a traditional ETL and a semantic ETL (i.e. *Ontobridge*).

Here you will find tools to perform data transformation processes, either in a traditional or semantic way. This repository is designed to facilitate the extraction, transformation and loading of data in different contexts.

- ETL-DBT: In this folder, you will find tools and scripts to perform ETL processes in a traditional way, using *Meltano* for data ingestion and *DBT* for data transformation. 

- Ontrobridge: In this folder,you will find tools and scripts to perform ETL processes in a semantic way, using *Ontobridge*. Concretly, you will find an *Ontobridge* submodule, an ontology-based tool, created by the Hospital Cl√≠nic de Barcelona.
